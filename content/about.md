Hi! I'm Charles, a communist militant from Quebec. I'm also active in the cubing community, which I got into around early 2014. All the relevant information about that is on its own page, from the algorithms I use to resources I often share to people. 

I've also been studying Marxism since December 2020, and stand as a Marxist-Leninist, drawing inspiration from indigenous struggles at home and deep ecology. I am a member of the Communist Party of Canada.

Regarding content creation, I have made my fair share of videos, more recently  longer-form educational content about social analysis. My goal on  YouTube is to share insightful thoughts on various social and political  topics from a Marxist perspective.
