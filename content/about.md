Hi! I'm Charles, a communist militant from Quebec. I'm also active in the cubing community, which I got into around early 2014. All the relevant information about that is on its own page, from the algorithms I use to resources I often share to people. 

I've also been studying Marxism since December 2020, and stand as a Marxist-Leninist. I've also been diving in the ideas of Murray Bookchin and Arne Naess, as well as cybernetic socialism and decentrally planned economies. I do think deep ecology and marxism are very intertwined and reconcilable.

Regarding content creation, I have made my fair share of videos, more recently  longer-form educational content about social analysis. My goal on  YouTube is to share insightful thoughts on various social and political  topics from a Marxist perspective. 

Here's one of my recent videos:
