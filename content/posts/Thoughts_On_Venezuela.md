These past few weeks, we have seen an exacerbation of the US' warmongering rhetoric as the state department realizes that the country is losing its grips on the unilateral hegemony it has enjoyed ever since the fall of the USSR in December of 1991.

The imperialist rhetoric towards Venezuela has been constantly changing in the past decades, from the good ole McCarthyite reaction to Chavismo socialism and 'dictatorship' to now claims of narcotrafficking (even though Venezuela doesn't even produce any cocaine or fentanyl).

The US department of war is thus multiplying its military provocations against Venezuela, mobilizing 4000 troops on several warships, and massacring at least 39 people on fishing boats under the guise of narcotrafficking, according to a recent Al-Jazeera article. Why would the US kill them instead of arresting them if they were trying to dismantle a cartel, you ask? Because it is utter bullshit, and the US's reasons to attack Venezuela are natural resources, a diminishing grasp on the global hegemony and a history of regime change in every nation moving towards socialism. A senior U.S. official recently said: *"The president is ready to use all elements of American power to drive Maduro out of power." The objective is clear.*

During this period, leader of venezuelan opposition Maria Corina Machado received the nobel peace prize after her calls for Venezuela to be invaded by the USA and Israel to overthrow Maduro's democratically elected government. Might I add that Machado claimed that "Hamas is hiding in Venezuela", on top of all he rother wild and unsupported claims.

As an RCI comrade Charles Royer said in his recent article on Venezuela: *"This is not the first time that this distinction has been awarded to a back-and-for-the-war imperialist. It was handed over to Henry Kissinger the same year that he organized the Pinochet coup in Chile, or to Barack Obama while he was sending more American troops to Afghanistan, to name but a few. Nevertheless, this is probably the first time that it has returned to a person who openly calls for the invasion of her own country!"*

Though I think it's superfluous to analyze just how much the Nobel peace prize committee is aligned with western imperialist interests, this situation speaks for itself.

The United States, led by Donald Trump, screwed up their own domination on trade with unreasonable tariffs, giving China the upper hand in global trade amongst its belt and road initiative, and are now grasping at thin air to reassert American dominance over south America.

However, as Marxists the priority here is clearly anti-imperialism, to pressure the US Department of War as well as Canada's government to get their dirty hands off of Venezuela. The masses of Venezuela have a right to self-determination and the USA has no right to interfere in their internal affairs for imperialist interests. Workers of the world, unite!
